Version control helps me track changes in my project over time. It allows me to save different versions, go back if I make mistakes, and understand how my work evolves. It also makes collaborating easier because multiple people can work on the same project without messing up each other’s files.

It helps me experiment with new ideas safely and keep a history of changes. I can always go back if something goes wrong.
