Version control helps me track changes in my project over time. It allows me to save different versions, go back if I make mistakes, and understand how my work evolves. It also makes collaborating easier because multiple people can work on the same project without messing up each other’s files.

It helps me experiment with new ideas safely and keep a history of changes. I can always go back if something goes wrong.

Version control perosnally has lets me do thesd small chnages very preciesly and i do not need to worry about losing my things for exalplt this is the 3rd time already i'm making a change in my code and i have not lost anything so far and i keep track of everything aswell which is very comforting like adding new features or fixing minor bugs, without breaking my main project.
